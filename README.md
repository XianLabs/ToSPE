Packet sender, logger, manipulator for Tree of Savior (Steam) MMORPG

Very old project. Last used when my group found a 0-day exploit for instant-kill monsters + mass silver farm (Sorien stole this exploit and added it to Hook64).

Code is unclean and rushed. Probably still works with a bit of AoB updating (0day exploit confirmed patched).
